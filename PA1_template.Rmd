## Loading and preprocessing the data

The data exists in the cloned directory, we get the data from a function:

```{r}
get.data <- function() {
    zipfile <- "./activity.zip"
    if (! file.exists("./activity.csv")) {
      stopifnot(file.exists(zipfile))
      unzip(zipfile)
    }
    activity <- read.delim(file = "./activity.csv", header = TRUE, sep = ",")
    activity$date <- as.Date(activity$date)
    activity
}

activity <- get.data()
```


## What is mean total number of steps taken per day?



## What is the average daily activity pattern?



## Imputing missing values



## Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?
